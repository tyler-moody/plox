Syntactic Grammar

Each rule in the grammar matches expressions at its precedence or higher

expression ->           equality ;

equality ->             comparison (("==" | "!=") comparison)* ;

comparison ->           additive ((">" | ">=" | "<" | "<=") additive)* ;

additive ->             multiplicative (("+" | "-") multiplicative)* ;

multiplicative ->       unary (("/" | "*") unary)* ;

unary ->                ("-" | "!") unary 
                        | primary ;

primary ->              NUMBER | STRING | "true" | "false" | "nil" 
                        | "(" expression ")" ;
